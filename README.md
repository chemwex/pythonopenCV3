# pythonopenCV3
In this project we create code that uses the camera to capture hand signals
This code captures video from the camera, processes each frame to detect hand movements using color segmentation, and displays the video with the detected hand highlighted. You can adjust the color range for better skin detection based on your environment and lighting conditions.
